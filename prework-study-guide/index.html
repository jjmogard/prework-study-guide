        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration tag at the beginning tells the browser what document type it should expect when opening</li>
          <li>HTML is the basic frame and structure of the house</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Had issue saving this html when prompted to. Asked if I wanted to compare or overwrite and it didn't state that in the lesson. This is a reminder to ask, but I'm on a roll and don't want to be sidetracked.</li>
          <li>Remember to close out tags EVERY TIME!</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic that define a section in document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>id tags are used as a way to identify elements</li>
          <li>ul stands for unordered list which uses bullet points to list items using the li tag inside it</li>
          <li>li stands for list item which creates a new bullet point for each</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS is the style and design of the webpage/document, much like the color, size, and shape of the house</li>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

            <li>the git command must precede every Git statement</li>
            <li>the checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch</li>
            <li>the -b flag creates a new branch</li>
            <li>Git is software on your computer that tracks changes you make to your code</li>
            <li>Github is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code</li>
            <li>SSH keys are unique identifiers for coders using git</li>
            <li>Enter ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “your_email@example.com” in your terminal to create a new SSH key</li>
            <li>Enter ls -al ~/.ssh in your terminal to see if any existing SSH keys are present. Look for a public SSH key that ends in .pub. For example, id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, or id_ed25519.pub</li>
