# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description


- My motivation in this is to use this guide to help me through my bootcamp journey and to make me as knowledgeable as I can be in the field.
- I built this project because ther is a lot of information thrown at you in a short amount of time and this guide should aid in remembering aspects of each area.
- This will help solve my problem of not remembering certain differences between topics and hopefully help others in need of answers.
- In doing this, I learned a great deal of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git and how all of them work together to create the magic we see every day on computer screens, tablets, phones, etc.
